Your Account is a deposit account. Money in your primary deposit account will &nbsp;not earn interest. Money in your Savings Account will earn interest as described herein. To &nbsp;open and use an Account, you must be 18 years of age or older and a citizen or lawfully &nbsp;residing in one of the 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c4">(collectively, the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">U.S.</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money &nbsp;laundering activities, federal law requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that &nbsp;identifies each person who opens an account. As such, when you apply for an Account, we &nbsp;will ask for your name, address, date of birth, social security number, mobile phone number (or, in our discretion, another type of phone number), and other information that will allow &nbsp;us to identify you. We may also use other methods of data collection, like device ID and &nbsp;geolocation data generated from your devices, and other sources of data to verify the &nbsp;personal information you provide to us, including, but not limited to, the collection and &nbsp;validation of your state-issued ID or other printed documentation and data related to your &nbsp;mobile phone, computer, and/or other devices. In addition, before you may use certain &nbsp;features of your Account, we may require you to undergo further identity or Account &nbsp;verification, including, but not limited to, activating your physical, personalized Card (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Personalized Card</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;), verifying your email address or mobile phone number, or &nbsp;uploading an image of your state-issued ID for verification. We reserve the right to not &nbsp;open an Account for anyone in our sole discretion. We may also limit the number of &nbsp;Accounts that you have in our sole discretion. </span></p><p class="c192"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">Limited-Use Starter Cards</span><span class="c4">. If you purchased an account starter package with a temporary &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c399"><span class="c4">ard at a retail store or if you received a temporary card in the mail on an unsolicited basis &nbsp;(each such card, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">limited-use starter card</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;), you must activate your Account by going to &nbsp;</span><span class="c17">http://</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c17">.com </span><span class="c4">or by using our </span><span class="c17">h t t p : / / sw i f tp a y u. c om </span><span class="c4">mobile &nbsp;application (our &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Mobile App</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) before you may use the limited-use starter card. Your &nbsp;limited-use starter card is subject to more limitations than the Personalized Card you &nbsp;may receive after activatingyour Account. You may not use your limited-use starter card: (i) for purchases at merchants that use a manual imprint machine; (ii) </span></p><p class="c298"><span class="c4">for cash access at tellers, unless otherwise indicated; or (iii) for purchases at merchants &nbsp;outside of the U.S. (including internet websites based outside the U.S.). In addition, if &nbsp;you have a limited-use starter card, you may not use the following features of your &nbsp;Account until you activate your Personalized Card: (1) the Check Cashing Service &nbsp;(as defined below); (2) the Bill Payment Service (as defined below); (3) Overdraft &nbsp;Protection (as defined below); (4) the Funds Transfer Services (as defined below); (5) &nbsp;Cash Back (as defined below); or (6) your Savings Account. Following additional identity &nbsp;verification, we may, in our sole discretion, allow you to use your limited-use starter &nbsp;card with some or all of the features of a Personalized Card, and we will notify you if we &nbsp;do.</span></p><p class="c255"><span class="c16">3 </span></p><p class="c222"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Limited-Use Accounts</span><span class="c4">. If you purchased an account starter package with a limited-use &nbsp;starter card at a retail store and we cannot verify your identity or for any other reason decide &nbsp;to not open an Account in your name, we may, in our sole discretion, allow you to have a &nbsp;limited-use account (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">limited-use account</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) for the sole purpose of spending the money &nbsp;you provided for your Initial Deposit (as defined below and further explained in Section &nbsp;3.a.). As such, a limited-use account cannot use the funds disbursement options available &nbsp;for the Cardless Funds Access Service (as defined below). Please see Appendix B for more &nbsp;information about limited-use accounts. </span></p><p class="c405"><span class="c4">2. </span><span class="c60 c45">Fees</span><span class="c4">. Our fee schedule below describes the fees associated with your Account and certain related services. We may offer additional products, services, and features from time to time, and the fees &nbsp;for those offerings will be disclosed to you at the time they are offered. In addition to the fees listed &nbsp;below, there are some situations where a third party may charge additional fees. For example, when &nbsp;you use an ATM to withdraw funds from your primary deposit account, you may be charged a fee &nbsp;by the ATM operator in addition to our fee. Except as expressly noted below, the fees listed in the &nbsp;schedule below will be deducted from your primary deposit account balance when they are &nbsp;assessed. If your primary deposit account balance is less than the fee amount or your primary &nbsp;deposit account balance is negative, the assessment of the fee will result in a negative balance in &nbsp;your primary deposit account or increase the negative balance of your primary deposit account, as &nbsp;applicable. If that occurs, any subsequent deposits or credits to your primary deposit account will &nbsp;first be applied to the negative balance. For more information about negative balances, see Section &nbsp;9.c. titled &ldquo;Negative Balances&rdquo;. In the case of a Funding Transaction (defined below) involving an &nbsp;external account, if your primary deposit account balance is less than the total transfer amount, &nbsp;including the Funding Transaction Fee, the transfer request will be declined. </span></p><a id="t.51e1320a484a3a5a4cded17833c1bf7da92b79e2"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c73"><tr class="c91"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c25"><span class="c10">Fee Type </span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c25"><span class="c10">Fee</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c62"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c253"><span class="c4">Card Purchase Fee</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c338"><span class="c4 c37">Up to $</span><span class="c17 c37">3.000 </span><span class="c4 c37">This is a one-time fee for </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c37">the purchase of a limited-use starter card </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c37">retai</span><span class="c4">l store.</span><span class="c49">1</span><span class="c102 c148">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c135"><span class="c4 c37">at a </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c364"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c237"><span class="c17">Upgrade fees</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c195"><span class="c4">$</span><span class="c17">15,000 </span><span class="c4">Waived when you receive </span><span class="c16 c37">at </span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">least &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c161"><span class="c4 c37">one direct deposit of payroll or government </span><span class="c4">b</span><span class="c4 c37">enefits during the previous monthly </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c102 c306">statement period </span><span class="c148 c160">that is above your account limit </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c4">In-Network ATM Withdrawal </span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c158"><span class="c4">$0 </span></p><p class="c216"><span class="c4 c37">&ldquo;In-Network&rdquo; refers to all ATMs in our </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c37">network that are surcharge-free.

You may arrange to have funds transferred directly to your primary &nbsp;deposit account by your employer or other appropriate payor once we have successfully &nbsp;verified your personal information. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to &nbsp;your primary deposit account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, &nbsp;you can call us at visit </span><span class="c17">http://</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c17">.com</span><span class="c4">, or use our Mobile App to find &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c142"><span class="c4">out whether or not the deposit has been made. Funds from direct deposits will &nbsp;generally be available on the day we receive the transfer. In case of transmission error or &nbsp;transfer irregularity, your ability to withdraw funds may be delayed. If this occurs, funds &nbsp;will generally be available within five business days after we receive the transfer. We reserve the right to reject or limit transfers via direct deposit in our sole discretion and may &nbsp;reject or suspend any direct deposit that has identifying information that does not match &nbsp;the identifying information (such as name or social security number) that we have on file &nbsp;for you. You may cancel your direct deposit authorization at any time by sending a written &nbsp;notice to your employer or payor and providing your employer or payor and the Bank &nbsp;sufficient time to act upon the notice. </span></p><p class="c378"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Check Cashing Service</span><span class="c4">. Once you have activated your Personalized Card, you can use the &nbsp;Check Cashing Service offered by Ingo to cash eligible checks to your primary deposit &nbsp;account via our Mobile App. Even though we may allow you to use the Check Cashing &nbsp;Service to add money to your primary deposit account, we do not provide this service and &nbsp;are not responsible for any service-related issues. To use the Check Cashing Service, you &nbsp;will need to agree to the terms and conditions Ingo establishes from time to time, which &nbsp;are provided to you at the time you access the Check Cashing Service through our Mobile &nbsp;App (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Ingo Terms</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). Although we do not charge any fees to cash a check through the &nbsp;Check Cashing Service, Ingo may charge a fee depending on the funding option you select. &nbsp;See the fee schedule in Section 2 titled &ldquo;Fees&rdquo; and the Ingo Terms for additional details. &nbsp;Ingo should notify you about any fee for a particular deposit before you authorize the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c362"><span class="c16">7 </span></p><p class="c105"><span class="c4">deposit. Ingo also may impose certain limits disclosed to you in the Ingo Terms. You may &nbsp;also cash eligible checks to your primary deposit account using the mobile application &nbsp;hosted by Ingo, or other third-party mobile applications that support this functionality, &nbsp;instead of our Mobile App. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c343"><span class="c4">4. </span><span class="c60 c45">Funds Availability</span><span class="c4">. For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day &nbsp;except Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and legal banking holidays in the State of Utah. </span></p><p class="c213"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">Cash Deposits. </span><span class="c4">Cash deposits made through participating retailers are generally made &nbsp;available within 60 minutes from the time the transaction is reported to our technology &nbsp;systems by the retailer. Fees of up to $4.95 may be collected by retailers when depositing &nbsp;cash to your primary deposit account at their locations. This fee is charged by the retailer &nbsp;and is subject to change. This fee is not deducted from your Account and will not be &nbsp;reflected in any periodic statement. This fee can be lower depending on how and where &nbsp;you deposit cash. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c215"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">Direct Deposits. </span><span class="c4">Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the &nbsp;deposit. Please keep in mind, however, that after we make funds available to you, and you &nbsp;have spent, transferred, or withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for any problems &nbsp;involving your deposit. If a deposit is made on a business day, we will consider that day to &nbsp;be the day of your deposit. However, if a deposit is made on a non-business day or on a &nbsp;day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day. Please note that Ingo maintains separate cutoff times for the Check Cashing Service it &nbsp;administers, as explained in Section c below. </span></p><p class="c371"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Check Deposits</span><span class="c4">. The Ingo Terms set forth rules regarding funds availability for checks &nbsp;cashed through the Check Cashing Service. </span></p><p class="c352"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Special Rules for New Accounts</span><span class="c4">. During the first 30 days your Account is open, funds from &nbsp;deposits of cash will be available on or before the first business day after the day of your &nbsp;deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions. We may also impose different funds &nbsp;availability limits for other forms of deposits during the first 30 days your Account is open. </span></p><p class="c384"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Other Types of Deposits</span><span class="c4">. Funds availability rules for other types of deposits will be &nbsp;disclosed to you at the time those other deposit options are offered to you. </span></p><p class="c261"><span class="c4">5. </span><span class="c60 c45">About Your Card and Account</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c385"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">General. </span><span class="c4">Your Card is linked to your primary deposit account, and not your Savings &nbsp;Account. You will be able to receive a personal identification number (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">PIN</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) for your &nbsp;visual Card.You agree not to disclose your PIN to others and to safeguard its &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c4">confidentiality. Except as otherwise provided, and subject to the limits specified in this &nbsp;Agreement, you may use your </span><span class="c17">visual </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c4">Card to purchase goods and services anywhere Visa debit cards (as applicable) are accepted &nbsp;and to access cash at ATMs and from tellers of financial institutions displaying the Visa &nbsp;name and/or logo, as applicable. Please note that if you use your Card to get Account </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c16">8 </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">balance information from an ATM, the balance may not reflect recent transactions and may &nbsp;include funds that are not available for immediate withdrawal; see Section 9 titled &ldquo;We &nbsp;Use The Available Balance Method&rdquo; for more information. </span></p><p class="c132"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">Charges to Your Card and Receipts. </span><span class="c4">Each time you use your Card to purchase goods or services, you authorize us to charge the amount against the money in your Account. You &nbsp;should get a receipt at the time you make a transaction or obtain cash using your Card. </span></p><p class="c345"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Limits on the Use of Your Card and Account</span><span class="c4">. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, &nbsp;to limit the amount, number, and type of transactions you can make using your Account. We may, in our sole discretion, further limit your use of your Card at ATMs, and, in &nbsp;addition to our limits, an ATM owner or operator may impose additional withdrawal limits. &nbsp;We may refuse to process any transaction that we believe may violate the law or the terms &nbsp;of this Agreement. You agree that you will: (i) not use your Card or Account at unlawful &nbsp;domestic or international gambling websites, at payment processors supporting unlawful &nbsp;gambling websites, or to purchase illegal goods or services; (ii) promptly notify us of any &nbsp;loss or theft of your Card; (iii) promptly notify us of the loss, theft, or unauthorized &nbsp;disclosure of any PIN used to access your Account; and (iv) use your Card only as &nbsp;permitted by us. We may refuse to issue a Card, revoke or suspend your Card or Account &nbsp;privileges, or cancel your Card or Account with or without cause or notice, other than as &nbsp;required by applicable law. You agree not to use or allow others to use an expired, revoked, &nbsp;canceled, suspended, or otherwise invalid Card. You cannot sell or transfer your Account &nbsp;to anyone else, and it can only be used by you or someone you authorize. If you authorize &nbsp;anyone else to use your Card or Account, you are responsible for all transactions made by &nbsp;that person, even if they exceed the authorization granted. Your Card can only be used for &nbsp;cash withdrawals at ATMs and for teller cash withdrawals in the U.S. and its territories, &nbsp;Canada, and Mexico. We may, in our sole discretion, allow you to use your Card for cash &nbsp;withdrawals in other countries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to limit &nbsp;or block the use of your Card in foreign countries due to fraud or security concerns or to &nbsp;comply with applicable law. </span></p><p class="c310"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Money in Your Account May Be Held Until a Transaction is Completed. </span><span class="c4">When you use &nbsp;your Card or primary deposit account to pay for goods or services, certain merchants may &nbsp;ask us to authorize or &ldquo;hold&rdquo; the transaction in advance and may estimate the final purchase &nbsp;amount. In addition, when you use your Card for an ATM withdrawal or a teller cash &nbsp;withdrawal, we generally authorize the transaction in advance (including all applicable &nbsp;fees). When we authorize a transaction, we commit to make the requested funds available &nbsp;when the transaction finally settles and will place a hold on your primary deposit account&rsquo;s &nbsp;funds for the amount indicated by the merchant, and this transaction will show as &ldquo;pending&rdquo; &nbsp;in your transaction history. We also may add an amount for transactions with certain &nbsp;merchants to ensure that sufficient funds will be available to cover the final transaction &nbsp;amount (such as to cover a tip at a restaurant). Transactions with certain merchants that &nbsp;authorize high dollar amounts, such as rental car companies and hotels, and certain cash &nbsp;and international transactions may cause a hold on money in your primary deposit account</span></p><p class="c277"><span class="c16">9 </span></p><p class="c93"><span class="c4">for up to 90 days. You will not be able to use the money in your primary deposit account that is on hold until the transaction finally settles or the hold is otherwise released. For &nbsp;more information about how we determine the amount of money in your Account available &nbsp;for your use and withdrawal, see Section 9 titled &ldquo;We Use The Available Balance Method&rdquo;. &nbsp;If a pending transaction is not presented to us for payment within our established time &nbsp;period after being authorized (typically, three business days, but may be up to 90 days for &nbsp;certain types of transactions, as described above), we will release the hold. Note that if a &nbsp;transaction is presented to us for payment from your primary deposit account after we have &nbsp;released the hold, we must honor the transaction, which may result in a negative balance &nbsp;in your primary deposit account. For more information about negative balances, see &nbsp;Section 9.c. titled &ldquo;Negative Balances&rdquo;. When a transaction finally settles, we will charge &nbsp;your primary deposit account for the amount of the final transaction, including any &nbsp;applicable fees, and then will release the hold on any remaining amount on money, as &nbsp;applicable. </span></p><p class="c292"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Foreign Transactions</span><span class="c4">. If you conduct a Foreign Transaction, the merchant, network, or &nbsp;card association that processes the Foreign Transaction may convert any related debit or &nbsp;credit into U.S. dollars in accordance with its then-current policies. Visa currently uses a &nbsp;conversion rate that is either: (i) selected from a range of rates available in wholesale &nbsp;currency markets on or one day prior to its central or transaction processing date (which &nbsp;rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives) or (ii) the government-mandated rate. The &nbsp;conversion rate may be different from the rate in effect on the date of the Foreign &nbsp;Transaction and the date it is posted to your primary deposit account. The Foreign &nbsp;Transaction Fee set forth in Section 2 titled &ldquo;Fees&rdquo; is in addition to any of the Bank&rsquo;s other fees, including, but not limited to, the teller cash withdrawal and ATM withdrawal fee. </span></p><p class="c99"><span class="c4">We monitor your Account for signs of potential fraud, which could include the use of your &nbsp;Card in a manner that is out of the ordinary. If you are planning on using your Card in a &nbsp;foreign country (for example, if you are traveling abroad), it is possible that your Foreign &nbsp;Transactions may be delayed or declined. For example, there are some countries in which &nbsp;we are required by law to block transactions and some countries for which we will not &nbsp;authorize the use of your Account due to fraud, terrorism, or other concerns. Those &nbsp;countries change from time to time, so contact us in advance if you are planning on using &nbsp;your Card in a foreign country and want to confirm that the Card can be accepted in that &nbsp;country. </span></p><p class="c368"><span class="c4">f. </span><span class="c8">ATM Safety</span><span class="c4">. You agree to exercise discretion when using ATMs. If there are any suspicious &nbsp;circumstances, do not use an ATM. If you notice anything suspicious while transacting &nbsp;business at an ATM, cancel the transaction, pocket your Card, and leave. Be careful when &nbsp;using an ATM and be aware of the surroundings, especially at night or in isolated areas. </span></p><p class="c401"><span class="c4">Park near an ATM in a well-lighted area. At night, have someone accompany you to an &nbsp;ATM when possible. Do not approach a dark ATM. Do not accept assistance from anyone &nbsp;while using an ATM. Do not display your cash; pocket it and count it later in the safety of &nbsp;your office or home. Be sure to save your ATM transaction receipts. Check them against </span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c16">10 </span></p><p class="c332"><span class="c4">your statements regularly. Prepare deposits at home to minimize your time at an ATM. Make sure you safeguard your PIN; do not write it on your Card or carry it in your wallet &nbsp;or purse. Always secure your Card just like you would your cash, checks, and credit cards. Report all crimes to the ATM operator and local law enforcement officials immediately. </span><span class="c10">We do not guarantee your safety while using ATMs. </span></p><p class="c123"><span class="c4">g. </span><span class="c8">Refunds on Purchases</span><span class="c4">. Cash refunds will not be made to you for purchases made with your &nbsp;Card. If a merchant gives you a credit for merchandise returns or adjustments, it may do so &nbsp;by processing a credit adjustment, which we will apply as a credit to your primary deposit &nbsp;account. For security reasons, if a credit is applied to your primary deposit account for &nbsp;which there was no debit originally, we may block the use of your Account. </span></p><p class="c165"><span class="c4">6. </span><span class="c60 c45">Limits on Your Account</span><span class="c4">. In addition to any other limits included in this Agreement, your Account &nbsp;is subject to the following limits: </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">Account Balance</span><span class="c4">. The maximum Account balance is $</span><span class="c17">5</span><span class="c4">,000, but we may, in our sole &nbsp;discretion, allow your Account balance to exceed this limit. </span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c211 c102">b. </span><span class="c102 c168">Daily Cash Deposits. </span><span class="c102 c211">You may deposit up to $3,000 in cash per day</span><span class="c136">, above this attract fine of $15,000 for upgrade</span></p><p class="c48"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Daily and Monthly Cash Withdrawals. </span><span class="c4">You may withdraw up to $500 in cash from ATMs &nbsp;per day and up to $3,000 in cash from ATMs per month. You may withdraw up to $3,000 &nbsp;in cash through teller withdrawal transactions per month. Please note that different limits &nbsp;apply if you are withdrawing cash pursuant to the Cardless Funds Access Service as &nbsp;described further in Section 14.v. We may, in our sole discretion, permit you to withdraw &nbsp;higher amounts of cash. </span></p><p class="c288"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Total Daily Purchase and Cash Withdrawal. </span><span class="c4">You may perform purchase and cash &nbsp;withdrawal transactions up to $</span><span class="c17">5</span><span class="c4">,000 per day using your Card, unless you are withdrawing &nbsp;cash pursuant to the Cardless Funds Access Service, as described further in Section 14.v, to which different limits apply. </span></p><p class="c154"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Funding Transactions Involving an External Account</span><span class="c4">. You may perform Funding &nbsp;Transactions that involve an external account up to $1,500 per month. A &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Funding &nbsp;Transaction</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; refers to a near real-time transfer of funds from your Account to another &nbsp;network-branded account (e.g., a Visa or Mastercard prepaid or debit card) that is &nbsp;authorized via a third-party platform (e.g., loading of a prepaid card account, moving funds &nbsp;into another financial account, external P2P transactions, or adding value to a digital &nbsp;wallet). </span></p><p class="c299"><span class="c4">f. </span><span class="c8">Other Limits. </span><span class="c4">You agree not to use your Account for business purposes. We may, in our &nbsp;sole discretion, close your Account if we determine that it is being used for business &nbsp;purposes. We may revoke or suspend your Account privileges or cancel your Account with &nbsp;or without cause or notice, other than as required by applicable law. </span></p><p class="c395"><span class="c4">7. </span><span class="c60 c45">Savings Account</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c402"><span class="c16">11 </span></p><p class="c369"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">General. </span><span class="c4">Your Savings Account consists of up to five separate interest-bearing subaccounts &nbsp;(each, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Vault</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) that you can establish as long as your primary deposit account is open &nbsp;with a positive balance and is in good standing. For purposes of this section, your primary &nbsp;deposit account is in &ldquo;good standing&rdquo; if it is not blocked or suspended for fraud or any &nbsp;other reason. There is no requirement to maintain a balance in a Vault </span><span class="c16">and </span><span class="c4">there is no &nbsp;minimum deposit required to earn the stated APY (as defined below). Additionally, there are no fees associated with the creation or maintenance of a Vault. You may close a Vault &nbsp;at any time, but you must first transfer any money in the Vault to your primary deposit &nbsp;account before doing so. Access to your Savings Account is only available through our &nbsp;Mobile App. </span></p><p class="c230"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">Good Standing; Negative Balances</span><span class="c4">. If your primary deposit account is suspended, blocked, or closed, your Vaults will not earn or be paid interest. However, if your primary deposit &nbsp;account is suspended or blocked during a calendar quarter, and that suspension or block is &nbsp;subsequently lifted before the end of the calendar quarter, your Vaults will earn and be paid &nbsp;interest for that calendar quarter in accordance with Section 7.d. below. The Available &nbsp;Balance (as defined below) of your Account does not include money in your Vaults. &nbsp;Without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under this Agreement or &nbsp;otherwise, money in your Vaults may be used by us to cure a negative balance in your &nbsp;primary deposit account or as otherwise provided in Section 14.r. titled &ldquo;Security Interest &nbsp;&amp; Setoff&rdquo;. As such, if you have a negative balance in your primary deposit account, as a &nbsp;result of Account fees, overdrafts, or any other reason, and you transfer money from a &nbsp;Vault to your primary deposit account, we will first apply the money you transfer from the &nbsp;Vault to the negative balance in your primary deposit account. </span><span class="c16">W</span><span class="c4">e will not use funds in &nbsp;your Vaults, however, to prevent an overdraft of your primary deposit account. Therefore, &nbsp;if you have opted in to and are eligible for Overdraft Protection, you may incur overdraft &nbsp;fees if you overdraw your primary deposit account even if you have funds in your Vaults. </span></p><p class="c390"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Transfers; Transfer Limitations</span><span class="c4">. You can only transfer money to and from a Vault through &nbsp;your primary deposit account. You cannot otherwise spend, withdraw, transfer, or access &nbsp;money in a Vault, and you cannot directly transfer money between Vaults. When you want &nbsp;to access money in a Vault, you must first transfer the money to your primary deposit &nbsp;account. Transfers between your primary deposit account and a Vault can be conducted &nbsp;only through the Mobile App; we do not accept transfer instructions over the phone or by &nbsp;any other means. Once you instruct us to transfer money from your primary deposit account &nbsp;to a Vault, that money will be unavailable for you to otherwise spend, withdraw, transfer, &nbsp;or access from your primary deposit account. Although, the Available Balance of your &nbsp;Account does not include money in your Vaults, the money in your Vaults is counted for &nbsp;purposes of the maximum Account balance limit in Section 6 titled &ldquo;Limits on Your &nbsp;Account&rdquo;. For security reasons, we may impose limits on the numbers of transfers between &nbsp;your primary deposit account and your Vaults in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding &nbsp;anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for all funds in a Vault, we reserve the right at &nbsp;any time to require at least seven days&rsquo; written notice of an intended transfer to your &nbsp;primary deposit account.</span></p><p class="c290"><span class="c16">12 </span></p><p class="c380"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Interest</span><span class="c4">. The current rate at which interest may be paid on the Vaults, and the corresponding &nbsp;annual percentage yield (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">APY</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;), can be found in the Vault feature in the Mobile App. On &nbsp;a quarterly basis, interest will be calculated and separately credited to each open Vault on the Interest Payout Date (as defined below), subject to the terms of this Section 7. Interest &nbsp;for each Vault is calculated by: (i) applying the current interest rate to the average daily &nbsp;balance across all of your Vaults for the calendar quarter, subject to the maximum average &nbsp;daily balance limit specified below, and (ii) multiplying the amount in clause (i) by the &nbsp;average daily balance in the applicable Vault for the calendar quarter divided by the &nbsp;average daily balance across all Vaults for the calendar quarter. The average daily balance &nbsp;of a Vault for a calendar quarter is calculated by adding together the balances in the Vault &nbsp;for every day the Vault is open during the calendar quarter and dividing that amount by the &nbsp;number of days in the calendar quarter. In the event your primary deposit account is &nbsp;suspended or blocked, and that suspension or block is subsequently lifted during the same &nbsp;calendar quarter, the average daily balance of a Vault for that calendar quarter is calculated &nbsp;by adding together the balances in the Vault for every day the primary deposit account is &nbsp;not blocked or suspended during the calendar quarter and dividing that amount by the &nbsp;number of days in the calendar quarter. </span><span class="c10">Interest will be calculated on a maximum &nbsp;average daily balance, aggregated across all of your Vaults, of $5,000. You will not &nbsp;earn interest on any average daily balance that exceeds $5,000 across all of your &nbsp;Vaults. We may, at our discretion, change the interest rate, and the corresponding &nbsp;APY, at any time. </span><span class="c4">If we change the interest rate, and the corresponding APY, such change &nbsp;will take effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter. We will credit interest in whole &nbsp;cents, after rounding to the nearest cent, to the applicable Vault upon the start of the first &nbsp;monthly statement period following the end of the calendar quarter (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Interest Payout &nbsp;Date</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). Because interest is credited to your Vaults only after each calendar quarter ends, &nbsp;the amount of accrued interest is not added to the daily balance of your Vaults during the &nbsp;calendar quarter. That means that accrued interest does not compound prior to being &nbsp;credited to your Vaults. </span><span class="c10">If a Vault is closed prior to the end of the calendar quarter or &nbsp;the Interest Payout Date, interest will not be credited to the Vault for the calendar &nbsp;quarter. </span></p><p class="c219"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Taxes </span></p><p class="c344"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">General. </span><span class="c4">You are responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all &nbsp;taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with the interest paid &nbsp;on your Vaults, as applicable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c228"><span class="c4">ii. </span><span class="c8">Backup Withholding. </span><span class="c4">We may ask you to certify your name and social security &nbsp;number to avoid potential backup withholding and to report interest income paid &nbsp;to you in connection with the Vaults. In addition, we may also ask you to certify &nbsp;that you are not subject to backup withholding. If the Internal Revenue Service &nbsp;(&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">IRS</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) notifies us that we do not have a correct social security number for you, &nbsp;we may be required to withhold and remit to the IRS a percentage of interest paid &nbsp;to your Vaults.</span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c16">13 </span></p><p class="c77"><span class="c4">8. </span><span class="c60 c45">Electronic Fund Transfers; Other Rights &amp; Terms</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c209"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">Your Liability for Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers. </span><span class="c10">Tell us AT ONCE if you &nbsp;believe your Card or PIN has been lost or stolen or funds have been transferred from &nbsp;your Account without your permission.

You agree to cooperate &nbsp;reasonably with us and our agents and service providers in our attempts to recover funds &nbsp;from, and to assist in the prosecution of, any unauthorized users of your Account. </span></p><p class="c167"><span class="c4">We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from &nbsp;you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up &nbsp;to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provide &nbsp;a provisional credit to your Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is &nbsp;in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time that it takes us to &nbsp;complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and &nbsp;we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not provide a provisional credit to your Account. </span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c16">14 </span></p><p class="c240"><span class="c4">For errors involving new Accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated &nbsp;transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new &nbsp;Accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to provide a provisional credit to your &nbsp;Account for the amount you think is in error. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.

If we do not complete an electronic fund &nbsp;transfer to or from your Account on time or in the correct amount according to this &nbsp;Agreement, we may be liable for your losses or damages under section 910 of the &nbsp;Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Title IX of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. &nbsp;&sect;&sect; 1693 </span><span class="c8">et seq</span><span class="c4">.). There are some exceptions, however. We will not be liable, for instance: (i) if through no fault of ours, your Account has insufficient funds for the transaction or the &nbsp;funds are unavailable for withdrawal (e.g., because they have not been finally collected or &nbsp;are subject to legal process); (ii) if the transaction would exceed your Overdraft Protection &nbsp;limit, if any; (iii) if the ATM where you are trying to make a withdrawal does not have &nbsp;enough cash; (iv) if the system, ATM, or point-of-sale terminal was not working properly &nbsp;and you knew about the problem when you started the transaction; (v) if a merchant refuses &nbsp;to honor your Card; (vi) if you attempt to use a Card that has not been properly activated; &nbsp;(vii) if the information supplied by you or a third party is incorrect, incomplete, ambiguous, or untimely; (viii) if your Card has been reported as lost, stolen, or compromised or has &nbsp;been suspended by us, if we have limited or revoked your Account privileges, or if we have &nbsp;reason to believe the transaction is not authorized by you; (ix) if the transaction cannot be &nbsp;completed because your Card is damaged; (x) if circumstances beyond our control (such &nbsp;as fire, flood, water damage, power failure, strike, labor dispute, pandemic, computer &nbsp;breakdown, telephone line disruption, or a natural disaster) or a rolling blackout prevent or &nbsp;delay the transfer despite reasonable precautions taken by us; or (xi) as otherwise provided &nbsp;in this Agreement. </span></p><p class="c355"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">How to Stop Preauthorized Transfers From Your Primary Deposit Account. </span><span class="c4">If you have &nbsp;told us in advance to make regular payments out of your primary deposit account, you can &nbsp;stop any of these payments by writing to us at Customer Care, P.O. Box 5100, Pasadena, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c243"><span class="c17">e m a i l o u r s u p p o r t f o r h e l p </span><span class="c4">. We must receive your request at least three &nbsp;business days before the payment is scheduled to be made. (Note: If you fail to give us &nbsp;your request at least three business days prior to a transfer, we may attempt, at our sole &nbsp;discretion, to stop the payment. We assume no responsibility for our failure or refusal to &nbsp;do so, however, even if we accept the request for processing.) If you call, we may require &nbsp;you to put your request in writing within 14 days after you call. If we do not receive the &nbsp;written confirmation within 14 days, we may honor subsequent debits to your primary &nbsp;deposit account. For individual payments, your request should specify the exact amount &nbsp;(dollars and cents) of the transfer you want to stop, the date of the transfer, and the identity &nbsp;of the payee. Unless you tell us that all future transfers to a specific recipient are to be </span></p><p class="c63"><span class="c16">15 </span></p><p class="c274"><span class="c4">stopped, we may treat your stop payment order as a request concerning the one transfer &nbsp;only. If you order us to stop one of these payments at least three business days before the &nbsp;transfer is scheduled and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages to &nbsp;the extent provided in this Agreement or required by applicable law. </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Varying Preauthorized Transfers. </span><span class="c4">If you have arranged in advance to make regular &nbsp;payments out of your primary deposit account and they may vary in amount, the person &nbsp;you are going to pay should tell you, at least 10 days before each payment, when it will be &nbsp;made and how much it will be. The person you are going to pay may give you the option &nbsp;of receiving this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount &nbsp;from the previous payment or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you &nbsp;set. </span></p><p class="c203"><span class="c4">f. </span><span class="c8">Account Statements</span><span class="c4">. You will get an Account statement each monthly statement period &nbsp;(unless there are no transfers in a particular month). In any case, you will get an Account &nbsp;statement at least quarterly, unless your Account is dormant or inactive. Your statement &nbsp;will be a combined statement that will reflect both your primary deposit account and your &nbsp;Savings Account. You will have access to these statements at </span><span class="c17">http://</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c17">.com </span></p><p class="c178"><span class="c4">and via our Mobile App. We do not mail paper statements. </span></p><p class="c377"><span class="c4">g. </span><span class="c8">Business Days</span><span class="c4">.

We may add to, delete, or change the terms of &nbsp;this Agreement at any time by mailing, emailing, or delivering a notice, a statement &nbsp;message, or an amended agreement to you at the last address (location or email) on file for &nbsp;you, your Account, or the service in question. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, &nbsp;we may amend this Agreement without prior notice (e.g., by posting the information on &nbsp;https://www.</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">or otherwise making it available to you). We may substitute &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c406"><span class="c4">similar services or discontinue currently offered services by giving you prior notice. We &nbsp;do not have to notify you, however, of any changes that are beneficial to you (e.g., a &nbsp;reduction or waiver of any fees or the addition of services) or if the change is required for &nbsp;security reasons.</span></p><p class="c232"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">Information Given to Third Parties. </span><span class="c4">We may disclose information to third parties about &nbsp;you, your Account, and the transactions on your Account: (i) where it is necessary or &nbsp;helpful for completing transactions; (ii) in order to verify the existence and condition of &nbsp;your Account for a third party (e.g., a merchant); (iii) in order to comply with government &nbsp;agency or court orders; (iv) if you give us your consent; (v) to service providers who &nbsp;administer your Account or perform data processing, records management, collections, and &nbsp;other similar services for us, in order that they may perform those services; (vi) in order to &nbsp;identify, prevent, investigate, or report possible suspicious or illegal activity; (vii) in order &nbsp;to issue authorizations for transactions on your Account; (viii) to disclose the existence, &nbsp;history, and condition of your Account to consumer reporting agencies; and (ix) as &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c16">16 </span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c4">permitted by our Privacy Policy.

The &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Available Balance</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; of your &nbsp;Account is defined as the most current record of the amount of money in your Account &nbsp;available for your use or withdrawal, which does not include any money in your Savings &nbsp;Account. We use the Available Balance to authorize your transactions during the day (e.g., &nbsp;Card purchases and ATM withdrawals). We also use the Available Balance to pay your &nbsp;transactions in our nightly processing. Note that the Available Balance of your Account &nbsp;may not represent the current balance of your Account due to pending transactions. We &nbsp;calculate your Available Balance as follows: </span></p><p class="c198"><span class="c4">i. We start with the ending daily Account (posted) balance from our prior business &nbsp;day nightly processing that includes all transactions deposited to or paid from your &nbsp;Account (excluding money in your Savings Account); </span></p><p class="c386"><span class="c4">ii. We subtract from this amount any holds placed on a deposit to your Account and &nbsp;any holds placed due to legal process; </span></p><p class="c376"><span class="c4">iii. We add pending deposits that are immediately available for your use (see Section &nbsp;4 titled &ldquo;Funds Availability&rdquo; for details); and </span></p><p class="c330"><span class="c4">iv. We subtract pending withdrawals that we have either authorized (such as Card &nbsp;purchases and ATM withdrawals) or are known to us (such as your preauthorized &nbsp;automatic ACH (as defined below) withdrawals that we receive for payment from &nbsp;your Account) but have not yet processed (see Section 5.d. titled &ldquo;Money in Your &nbsp;Account May Be Held Until a Transaction is Completed&rdquo; for details). </span></p><p class="c121"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">How We Process (Post) Transactions to your Primary Deposit Account</span><span class="c4">. We may charge &nbsp;your primary deposit account on the day that a transaction is presented (or returned) to us &nbsp;directly or electronically for payment. We may charge your primary deposit account or &nbsp;place a hold on funds at an earlier time if we receive notice that an item deposited to your &nbsp;primary deposit account is being returned, or if we receive notice that your electronic &nbsp;payment (e.g., at a point-of-sale) is being processed for collection. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Negative Balances</span><span class="c4">. You may not perform transactions that exceed the Available Balance &nbsp;of your Account, and we generally will not authorize or pay transactions that exceed the &nbsp;Available Balance of your Account, unless we decide, in our sole discretion, to authorize &nbsp;and pay such transactions because you have opted in to and are eligible for Overdraft &nbsp;Protection. Please note, however, that some merchants: (i) may not check with us for &nbsp;authorization of the transaction amount; (ii) may check with us for authorization of the &nbsp;transaction amount but later present a transaction for payment that is for a higher amount; &nbsp;or (iii) may not timely present a transaction to us for payment, and therefore some &nbsp;transactions may be paid from your primary deposit account even if the Available Balance </span></p><p class="c181"><span class="c16">17 </span></p><p class="c182"><span class="c4">of your Account is insufficient, resulting in a negative balance in your primary deposit &nbsp;account, and even though you have not opted in to and are not eligible for Overdraft &nbsp;Protection. In such event, your primary deposit account will not be charged overdraft fees if you have not opted in to Overdraft Protection. </span></p><p class="c205"><span class="c4">You are fully liable for the amount of any negative balance on your primary deposit &nbsp;account, including any applicable transaction fees. Any negative balance on your primary &nbsp;deposit account must be paid immediately, without notice or demand from us, by &nbsp;depositing funds to your primary deposit account. Without limiting any other provisions of &nbsp;this Agreement, if you do not deposit funds to your primary deposit account to cover a &nbsp;negative balance within 60 days of its creation, we may close your Account. Without &nbsp;limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to pursue collections for any negative balance on your primary deposit account, and we may offset any negative balance on your primary &nbsp;deposit account with subsequent deposits, funds in your Savings Account and other credits &nbsp;to your primary deposit account, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in &nbsp;accordance with Section 14.r. titled &ldquo;Security Interest &amp; Setoff&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c134"><span class="c4">10. </span><span class="c60 c45">Discretionary Overdraft Protection</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c307"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">Overview</span><span class="c4">. In general, you may not perform transactions that exceed the Available Balance &nbsp;of your Account. However, if you elect to participate in our optional overdraft protection &nbsp;service (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Overdraft Protection</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) by &ldquo;opting in&rdquo; and you satisfy our eligibility &nbsp;requirements, we may allow you, at our discretion, to make purchase transactions with your &nbsp;Card that exceed the Available Balance of your Account, subject to the limits and fees &nbsp;described in this Agreement. Please review the Overdraft Protection Opt-In Notice available at https://www.</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c4">.com or via our Mobile App. Our &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c4">eligibility requirements for Overdraft Protection are based on a set of automated rules &nbsp;that weigh numerous variables and accountholder behaviors, which may include the type, amount, and frequency of deposits to your primary deposit account, your Account status &nbsp;and transaction history, and the history of any other prior or current accounts with us. &nbsp;While we may, in our sole discretion, allow you to opt in to Overdraft Protection &nbsp;before you satisfy our eligibility requirements to use Overdraft Protection, we do not &nbsp;authorize and pay overdrafts for Card purchase transactions unless you opt in to &nbsp;Overdraft Protection and meet our eligibility requirements, except in certain limited &nbsp;circumstances described in this Agreement. We may modify the eligibility &nbsp;requirements, limits, fees, and other terms of Overdraft Protection or restrict or &nbsp;discontinue Overdraft Protection at any time, and we will provide notice of any changes &nbsp;as required by applicable law. </span></p><p class="c162"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">Opt-Out Option</span><span class="c4">. If you previously opted in to Overdraft Protection, you may opt out of &nbsp;Overdraft Protection at any time by logging in to your Account a t</span><span class="c17">http://</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c17">.com </span><span class="c4">or via our Mobile App. In general, your opt-out request will &nbsp;be effective immediately, and we will send you an email to confirm your opt-out request. &nbsp;If you opt out of Overdraft Protection, you will remain responsible for overdraft &nbsp;transactions, and any related overdraft fees and other applicable transaction fees, &nbsp;authorized prior to the effectiveness of your election to opt out of Overdraft Protection.</span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c16">18 </span></p><p class="c220"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Discretionary Service</span><span class="c4">. Overdraft Protection is not a loan or a line of credit. Even if you &nbsp;have opted in to Overdraft Protection, we are not obligated to pay any Card purchase &nbsp;transaction presented for payment that exceeds the Available Balance of your Account. &nbsp;Payment of such transactions by us is a discretionary, non-contractual courtesy and not a &nbsp;right of yours or an obligation of ours. Any discretionary payment by us of any overdraft &nbsp;transaction does not obligate us to pay any other overdraft transaction. We, in our sole and &nbsp;absolute discretion, may cease paying overdraft transactions at any time without prior &nbsp;notice of reason or cause. </span></p><p class="c279"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Eligible Transactions</span><span class="c4">. The only transactions that are eligible for Overdraft Protection are &nbsp;Card purchase transactions. We do not authorize or pay overdrafts for any other &nbsp;transactions, including, but not limited to, ATM withdrawals, payments through our Bill &nbsp;Payment Service, ACH transfers, fund transfers (including person-to-person fund transfers), payments toward the outstanding balance of your </span><span class="c17">Swift</span><span class="c4">GO2bank secured &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c226"><span class="c4">credit card,or teller cash withdrawals. </span></p><p class="c169"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Overdraft Protection Limit</span><span class="c4">. If you opt in to Overdraft Protection and satisfy our eligibility &nbsp;requirements, you may be assigned an Overdraft Protection limit determined by us in our &nbsp;sole discretion based on a set of automated rules that weigh numerous variables and &nbsp;accountholder behaviors, as described in Section 10.a above. We may increase or decrease &nbsp;your Overdraft Protection limit at any time in our sole discretion. We may decrease your &nbsp;Overdraft Protection limit to $0 if some or all of our eligibility requirements are no longer &nbsp;met, which may result in transactions being returned unpaid to merchants or third parties &nbsp;due to insufficient funds. You will remain responsible for overdraft transactions, and any &nbsp;related overdraft fees, authorized prior to a decrease in your Overdraft Protection limit. If you are assigned an Overdraft Protection limit, you may not select a higher limit, but we &nbsp;may allow you to lower your Overdraft Protection limit. The Overdraft Protection limit &nbsp;you may be assigned will be displayed in the Mobile App and after you log into your &nbsp;Account at https://www.</span><span class="c45">zenithpayu</span><span class="c17">.</span><span class="c4">com.</span></p><p class="c354"><span class="c321 c45">Please note that overdraft fees may not count towards your Overdraft Protection </span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c45 c321">limit.

If we authorize and pay a Card purchase transaction that exceeds the &nbsp;Available Balance of your Account, you must pay the negative balance, including any &nbsp;overdraft fees and other applicable transaction fees, immediately by depositing funds to &nbsp;your primary deposit account. We may, at any time, in our sole discretion and without &nbsp;notice to you, offset any negative balance in your primary deposit account with incoming &nbsp;deposits, funds in your Savings Account, and credits to your primary deposit account, and &nbsp;separately with funds from any other account you open or maintain with us. We will not, &nbsp;however, use funds in your Savings Account to prevent an overdraft transaction (see &nbsp;Section 7 titled &ldquo;Savings Account&rdquo; for details). </span></p><p class="c259"><span class="c16">19 </span></p><p class="c176"><span class="c4">g. </span><span class="c8">Fees for Overdraft Protection Transactions</span><span class="c4">. We will impose an overdraft fee if we pay a &nbsp;Card purchase transaction that exceeds the Available Balance of your Account, except as &nbsp;described below and in certain limited circumstances as described elsewhere in this &nbsp;Agreement. The overdraft fee is in addition to any other fees that may apply to a Card &nbsp;purchase transaction or your Account, as disclosed in this Agreement. The amount and &nbsp;applicability of the overdraft fee is as follows: </span></p><a id="t.31e974e291baa74da3ecfad596f15cbb5b1daceb"></a><a id="t.3"></a><table class="c275"><tr class="c58"><td class="c387" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c295 c359"><span class="c4">Overdraft Fee</span></p></td><td class="c76" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c25"><span class="c75">$</span><span class="c136">10,000</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c301"><span class="c4">For each transaction that is greater than &nbsp;$5 and overdraws your primary deposit &nbsp;account by more than $10, up to a &nbsp;maximum of ten overdraft fees per &nbsp;monthly statement period</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c43"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c235"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">Grace Period</span><span class="c4">. No overdraft fee will be assessed in connection with any overdraft transaction if the Available Balance of your primary deposit account is returned to &nbsp;a $0 or positive balance within 24 hours after we authorize payment of the first &nbsp;transaction greater than $5 that overdraws your primary deposit account by more &nbsp;than $10. </span></p><p class="c151"><span class="c4">ii. </span><span class="c8">Order of Settlement</span><span class="c4">. Transactions are not always processed in the order in which &nbsp;you make them. The order in which the transactions are received and processed &nbsp;can affect the Available Balance of your Account and the total amount of overdraft &nbsp;fees assessed to your Account. Transactions are processed in the order we receive &nbsp;them for settlement. Multiple overdraft fees may be charged if multiple overdraft &nbsp;transactions are authorized on the same day. It is important to keep track of the &nbsp;Available Balance of your Account because it is your responsibility to determine &nbsp;if you have overdrawn your primary deposit account, the day and time the &nbsp;overdraft transaction occurred, and the amount of any Card purchase transactions &nbsp;authorized and paid pursuant to Overdraft Protection. </span></p><p class="c319"><span class="c4">h. </span><span class="c8">Alerts</span><span class="c4">. We will send emails to your email address in our records (and also text messages to &nbsp;your mobile number in our records if you are enrolled in text alerts) in connection with &nbsp;your use of Overdraft Protection (e.g., to notify you when we increase or decrease your &nbsp;Overdraft Protection limit, when an overdraft occurs that might incur an overdraft fee, and &nbsp;when the grace period ends for purposes of avoiding an overdraft fee). </span></p><p class="c349"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">Suspension or Termination</span><span class="c4">. We may suspend or terminate your ability to use Overdraft &nbsp;Protection at any time without notice of reason or cause in our sole discretion. If we &nbsp;suspend or terminate your ability to use Overdraft Protection</span><span class="c16">, </span><span class="c4">this may result in transactions &nbsp;being returned unpaid to merchants or third parties due to insufficient funds, and you will &nbsp;remain responsible for overdraft transactions, and any related overdraft fees, authorized &nbsp;prior to the suspension or termination of your ability to use Overdraft Protection. </span></p><p class="c189"><span class="c16">20 </span></p><p class="c183"><span class="c4">j. </span><span class="c8">Limits</span><span class="c4">. We do not authorize and pay overdrafts if your access to Overdraft Protection has &nbsp;been suspended or terminated or if you have opted out of Overdraft Protection, except in &nbsp;certain limited circumstances described in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, &nbsp;if you overdraw your primary deposit account 10 times or more during a monthly statement &nbsp;period, we may suspend your access to Overdraft Protection for the remainder of the &nbsp;monthly statement period. </span></p><p class="c114"><span class="c4">k. </span><span class="c0">Important Notice About Overdraft Protection</span><span class="c10">. While Overdraft Protection may help &nbsp;you avoid transaction declines for important purchases, this is an expensive service &nbsp;and should not be relied upon to meet your credit needs. We encourage you to &nbsp;research alternative solutions that may be less expensive or more advantageous to you &nbsp;before you opt in to and use Overdraft Protection. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c4">11. </span><span class="c60 c45">Bill Payment Service</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c234"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c8">General. </span><span class="c4">If you have met our eligibility criteria, you can make payments to others from &nbsp;your primary deposit account using our bill payment service.

It &nbsp;is not the late date or grace period. </span></p><p class="c267"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Pay Date</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; is the day your Biller should receive your payment.</span></p><p class="c326"><span class="c16">21 </span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Payment Instruction</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; is the information provided by you to the Bill Payment Service for &nbsp;a payment to be made to the Biller (such as, but not limited to, Biller name, Biller account &nbsp;number, and Debit Date). </span></p><p class="c258"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Scheduled Payment</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; is a payment that has been scheduled through the Bill Payment &nbsp;Service but has not begun processing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c339"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Service Fees and Additional Charges</span><span class="c4">. There is no service fee for using the Bill Payment &nbsp;Service. We may change these fees as described in this Agreement.

Transactions begin processing on your Debit Date. The earliest Debit &nbsp;Date for Payment Instructions entered on a non-Business Day will be the next Business &nbsp;Day. When you schedule an individual payment, the earliest possible Pay Date for each &nbsp;Biller (typically five or fewer Business Days from the Debit Date) will be designated &nbsp;through the Bill Payment Service when you are scheduling the payment, and you must &nbsp;select a Debit Date so that the associated Pay Date is no later than the actual Due Date &nbsp;reflected on your Biller statement. </span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c4">When you schedule regular (i.e., recurring) payments to occur in advance, you will select &nbsp;only a Debit Date. You are responsible for ensuring that the Debit Date is sufficiently in &nbsp;advance of your Due Date to allow the Biller to receive the payment. We recommend that &nbsp;you allow at least five Business Days between the Debit Date and your Due Date. YOU &nbsp;ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LATE PAYMENTS THAT OCCUR BECAUSE YOU &nbsp;SCHEDULE THE DEBIT DATE TOO CLOSE TO THE DUE DATE. </span></p><p class="c206"><span class="c4">You are responsible for ensuring that there are sufficient funds in your primary deposit &nbsp;account on the Debit Date to complete the payment. </span></p><p class="c90"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance</span><span class="c4">. By providing us with names and account &nbsp;information of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to follow the &nbsp;Payment Instructions that we receive from you. In order to process payments more &nbsp;efficiently and effectively, you agree that we may edit or alter payment data or data formats &nbsp;in accordance with Biller directives. </span></p><p class="c207"><span class="c4">When we receive a Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your primary deposit &nbsp;account and remit funds on your behalf to your Biller so that the funds arrive on or as soon &nbsp;as reasonably possible after the Pay Date designated by you. You also authorize us to credit &nbsp;your primary deposit account for payments returned to us by the United States Postal &nbsp;Service or Biller. </span></p><p class="c342"><span class="c4">We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make all your payments properly. If we do &nbsp;not complete a payment from your primary deposit account on time or in the correct amount &nbsp;according to this Agreement, we will not be liable for your losses, costs, or expenses,</span></p><p class="c239"><span class="c16">22 </span></p><p class="c379"><span class="c4">except for your direct losses or damages to the extent directly relating to our gross &nbsp;negligence or intentional misconduct. We will also not be liable for your losses or damages &nbsp;if we are unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the existence of any &nbsp;one or more of the following circumstances: (i) if, through no fault of ours, your primary &nbsp;deposit account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction; (ii) the Bill &nbsp;Payment Service is not working properly and you know or have been advised about the &nbsp;malfunction before you execute the transaction; (iii) you have not provided us with the &nbsp;correct account information, or correct Payment Instructions; or (iv) circumstances beyond &nbsp;our control (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, pandemic or interference from an outside &nbsp;force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction and we have taken reasonable &nbsp;precautions to avoid those circumstances. There are other exceptions provided in this &nbsp;Agreement. Provided none of these exceptions are applicable, if we cause an incorrect &nbsp;amount of funds to be removed from your primary deposit account or cause funds from &nbsp;your primary deposit account to be directed to a Biller in a manner inconsistent with your &nbsp;Payment Instructions, or fail to initiate your payment in accordance with your Payment &nbsp;Instructions, we will only be responsible for returning those funds to your primary deposit &nbsp;account, or for directing to the proper Biller any previously misdirected transactions, and &nbsp;will have no further liability with respect to same, except as expressly provided for above. </span></p><p class="c180"><span class="c4">f. </span><span class="c8">Payment Methods</span><span class="c4">.

You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment &nbsp;(including recurring payments) by following the directions provided in the Bill Payment &nbsp;Service. There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. Once we have &nbsp;begun processing a payment, on the Debit Date, it cannot be cancelled or edited, and &nbsp;therefore a stop payment request must be submitted. </span></p><p class="c174"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">Stop Payment Requests</span><span class="c4">. Our ability to process a stop payment request will depend on the &nbsp;payment method and whether or not a check has cleared. We may also not have a &nbsp;reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a payment has been &nbsp;processed. If you desire to stop any payment that has already been processed, you must call &nbsp;us at </span><span class="c17">email </span><span class="c4">or write us at Customer Care, P.O. Box 5100, Pasadena, CA 91117 so that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">we receive your request at least three Business Days prior to the Pay Date.

The &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Bank Transfer Service</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; allows you to transfer funds to your primary deposit &nbsp;account (an &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Inbound Bank Transfer</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) from an eligible bank account in your &nbsp;name at a U.S. financial institution (your &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">External Bank Account</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). To use the &nbsp;Bank Transfer Service, we may require you to activate your Personalized Card. </span></p><p class="c316"><span class="c4">Although we may use any means to execute an Inbound Bank Transfer, we &nbsp;normally use the Automated Clearing House (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">ACH</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). You cannot use the Bank &nbsp;Transfer Service to transfer funds from your primary deposit account to your &nbsp;External Bank Account or another bank account. </span></p><p class="c388"><span class="c4">ii. The &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Debit Card Transfer Service</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; allows you to transfer funds to your primary &nbsp;deposit account (an &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Inbound Debit Card Transfer</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) from an External Bank &nbsp;Account that is linked to your Visa or Mastercard-branded debit card (your &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">External Debit Card Account</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). Although we may use any means to execute an &nbsp;Inbound Debit Card Transfer, funds are normally transferred via the network &nbsp;associated with the debit card that is linked to your External Debit Card Account. &nbsp;You cannot use the Debit Card Transfer Service to transfer funds from your &nbsp;primary deposit account to your External Debit Card Account or another bank &nbsp;account. </span></p><p class="c172"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">External Bank Account Verification</span><span class="c4">. Before you may use the Bank Transfer Service, we &nbsp;will verify your ownership of your External Bank Account by: (i) accessing your account &nbsp;information at the applicable U.S. financial institution and/or (ii) asking you to provide &nbsp;proof of your ownership. If we ask you to provide us information about your External Bank &nbsp;Account (e.g., your username and password), you agree that you are directly providing that &nbsp;information to us (and our designated service provider) so that we can access information &nbsp;about your External Bank Account online in order to verify your ownership of your &nbsp;External Bank Account. </span></p><p class="c293"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Your Representations and Warranties</span><span class="c4">. By using the Funds Transfer Services, you authorize &nbsp;us to act as your agent and attorney-in-fact for the limited purpose of gathering information &nbsp;about your External Bank Account and External Debit Card Account (collectively, your &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">External Accounts</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;), communicating with others regarding your transfer instructions, &nbsp;and processing your transfers via the Funds Transfer Services. You represent to us that: (i) &nbsp;the financial institutions for your External Accounts have expressly agreed to (or do not &nbsp;prohibit) those actions by us; (ii) you have the authority to grant us the right to conduct &nbsp;those activities; (iii) you are authorized to conduct transfers from your External Accounts via the Funds Transfer Services and such accounts are classified as consumer accounts; &nbsp;(iv) the information you provide to us regarding your External Accounts is accurate and &nbsp;complete; (v) you are an owner and authorized signer for your External Accounts and your &nbsp;External Accounts are titled in your name; and (vi) no other person&rsquo;s authorization is &nbsp;required for us to process your requested transfers via the Funds Transfer Services. The &nbsp;financial institutions that hold your External Accounts may contact us from time to time to </span></p><p class="c397"><span class="c16">27 </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">verify information about a pending transfer. You agree that we may provide any &nbsp;information needed to verify your instructions or otherwise process such transfer. </span></p><p class="c273"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Eligibility</span><span class="c4">. Not all types of accounts and debit cards are eligible for use with the Funds &nbsp;Transfer Services. You must check with the financial institutions for your External &nbsp;Accountsto determine if there are any restrictions regarding sending transfers via the Funds &nbsp;Transfer Services (e.g., 401k, IRA, savings, credit, and money market accounts may not &nbsp;be able to send transfers). We are not responsible for any costs or losses incurred if transfers &nbsp;are not permitted or are restricted by the financial institutions for your External Accounts or by applicable law. </span></p><p class="c128"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Fees</span><span class="c4">. There are no fees associated with an Inbound Bank Transfer. An Inbound Debit Card &nbsp;Transfer is subject to the fee set forth in Section 2 titled &ldquo;Fees&rdquo; above. For an Inbound &nbsp;Debit Card Transfer, the fee is based on, and added to, the amount you request to be &nbsp;transferred to your primary deposit account from your External Debit Card Account. This &nbsp;means that the amount of funds transferred to your primary deposit account is equal to the &nbsp;amount you request to be transferred and is not reduced by the amount of the Inbound Debit &nbsp;Card Transfer Fee. For example, if you request $100 to be transferred to your primary &nbsp;deposit account from your External Debit Card Account, the fee for the Inbound Debit &nbsp;Card Transfer will be (i) $1.50, and $101.50 will be debited from your External Debit Card &nbsp;Account if transferred before February 11, 2022, or (ii) $3.00, and $103.00 will be debited &nbsp;from your External Debit Card Account if transferred on or after February 11, 2022. Please &nbsp;note that the financial institutions for your External Accounts may separately charge fees &nbsp;in connection with transfers via the Funds Transfer Services (e.g., if the transfer results in &nbsp;an overdraft of your External Account). </span></p><p class="c400"><span class="c4">f. </span><span class="c8">Processing Times</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">Bank Transfer Service</span><span class="c4">. Inbound Bank Transfers are generally deposited to your &nbsp;primary deposit account within three business days of when you instruct us to make &nbsp;the transfer. The cutoff time for submitting instructions for Inbound Bank &nbsp;Transfers is 9:30 p.m. (Pacific Time). Instructions received after the cutoff time or &nbsp;on a non-business day may be processed by us on the next business day. Inbound &nbsp;Bank Transfers scheduled to be processed on a non-business day will be processed &nbsp;on the next business day. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c346"><span class="c4">ii. </span><span class="c8">Debit Card Transfer Service</span><span class="c4">. Inbound Debit Card Transfers are generally &nbsp;processed within minutes of your request, but could take up to 30 minutes in some &nbsp;cases. </span></p><p class="c296"><span class="c4">iii. We may delay, suspend, or cancel the processing of any transfer via the Funds &nbsp;Transfer Services for security and fraud purposes and as otherwise specified in this &nbsp;Agreement. We are not responsible for any losses or damages that may result from &nbsp;our delay, suspension, or cancellation of a transfer, or for any failure to notify you </span></p><p class="c260"><span class="c16">28 </span></p><p class="c84"><span class="c4">of such delay, suspension, or cancellation. We cannot guarantee the timely delivery &nbsp;of funds as a result of a failure of another financial institution to act in a timely &nbsp;manner. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as otherwise &nbsp;required by applicable law, transfers authorized via the Funds Transfer Services are non-refundable and cannot be cancelled after you submit instructions for us to &nbsp;make a transfer. </span></p><p class="c317"><span class="c4">g. </span><span class="c8">Limits. </span><span class="c4">Your use of the Funds Transfer Services is subject to the following limits: </span></p><p class="c233"><span class="c4">i. </span><span class="c8">Bank Transfer Service</span><span class="c4">. The minimum amount of an Inbound Bank Transfer is $1 per transfer. The maximum amount of your first Inbound Bank Transfer is $100. &nbsp;Subject to the foregoing limit, you may perform up to $1,000 in Inbound Bank &nbsp;Transfers in any rolling 24-hour period, and up to $3,000 in Inbound Bank &nbsp;Transfers in any rolling 30-day period. If you have already authorized an Inbound &nbsp;Bank Transfer, you may not authorize another Inbound Bank Transfer until five &nbsp;days after the date you previously authorized the first Inbound Bank Transfer. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c322"><span class="c4">ii. </span><span class="c8">Debit Card Transfer Service</span><span class="c4">. The minimum amount of an Inbound Debit Card &nbsp;Transfer is (1) $1 per transfer, excluding applicable fees, before February 11, 2022, &nbsp;or (2) $10 per transfer, excluding applicable fees, on or after February 11, 2022. &nbsp;The maximum amount of an Inbound Debit Card Transfer is (1) $1,000 per &nbsp;transfer, excluding applicable fees, before February 11, 2022, or (2) $500 per &nbsp;transfer, excluding applicable fees, on or after February 11, 2022.

PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR &nbsp;LEGAL RIGHTS. </span></p><p class="c208"><span class="c4">a. </span><span class="c0">Acknowledgment of Arbitration</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c10">Your Account is being made available and priced by &nbsp;the Bank on the basis of your acceptance of the following arbitration provision. By &nbsp;opening your Account, you acknowledge that you are giving up the right to litigate &nbsp;Claims (as defined below) if either party elects arbitration of the Claims pursuant to &nbsp;this provision, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, and you hereby &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c285"><span class="c16">37 </span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c10">knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to trial of all Claims subject to this &nbsp;Agreement. You further acknowledge that you have read this arbitration provision &nbsp;carefully, agree to its terms, and are entering into this Agreement voluntarily and not &nbsp;in reliance on any promises or representations whatsoever except those contained in &nbsp;this Agreement. </span></p><p class="c68"><span class="c4">b. </span><span class="c8">Arbitration of Claims. </span><span class="c4">Except as expressly provided herein, any claim, dispute, or &nbsp;controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; &nbsp;statute; common law; or equity and whether pre-existing, present, or future), including &nbsp;initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims, and third-party claims, arising from or relating &nbsp;to (i) your Card or Account; (ii) any service relating to your Card or Account; (iii) the &nbsp;marketing of your Card or Account; (iv) this Agreement, including the validity, &nbsp;enforceability, interpretation, scope, or application of this Agreement and this arbitration &nbsp;provision (except for the prohibition on class or other non-individual claims, which will be &nbsp;for a court to decide); and (v) any other agreement or instrument relating to your Card or &nbsp;Account or any related service (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Claim</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) will be decided, upon the election of you or the &nbsp;Bank (or Green Dot Corporation or the Bank&rsquo;s agents, employees, successors, &nbsp;representatives, affiliated companies, or assigns), by binding arbitration. Arbitration &nbsp;replaces the right to litigate a claim in court or to have a jury trial. The American Arbitration &nbsp;Association (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">AAA</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) will serve as the arbitration administrator. You may obtain copies of &nbsp;the current rules, forms, and instructions for initiating an arbitration with the AAA by &nbsp;contacting the AAA as follows: online at https://www.adr.org or by writing to the AAA at: &nbsp;American Arbitration Association, Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, &nbsp;Voorhees, NJ 08043. </span></p><p class="c249"><span class="c4">c. </span><span class="c8">Other Claims Subject to Arbitration. </span><span class="c4">In addition to Claims brought by either you or the &nbsp;Bank, Claims made by or against Green Dot Corporation or by or against anyone connected &nbsp;with you or the Bank or claiming through you or the Bank (including a second cardholder, &nbsp;employee, agent, representative, affiliated company, predecessor or successor, heir, &nbsp;assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy) will be subject to arbitration as described herein. </span></p><p class="c374"><span class="c4">d. </span><span class="c8">Exceptions. </span><span class="c4">We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate any individual Claim you bring &nbsp;in small claims court or an equivalent court so long as the Claim is pending only in that &nbsp;court. This arbitration provision also does not limit or constrain the Bank&rsquo;s right to &nbsp;interplead funds in the event of claims to Account funds by several parties. </span></p><p class="c109"><span class="c4">e. </span><span class="c8">Individual Claims Only. </span><span class="c4">Claims may be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis &nbsp;only. </span><span class="c10">Claims subject to this arbitration provision may not be joined or consolidated &nbsp;in arbitration with any Claim of any other person or be arbitrated on a class basis, in &nbsp;a representative capacity on behalf of the general public or on behalf of any other &nbsp;person, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. </span><span class="c4">However, co-applicants, &nbsp;second cardholders, and authorized users of a single Card and/or related cards are &nbsp;considered as one person, and the Bank, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and &nbsp;affiliates are considered as one person.</span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c16">38 </span></p><p class="c218"><span class="c4">f. </span><span class="c8">Arbitration Fees. </span><span class="c4">If you initiate arbitration, the Bank will advance any arbitration fees, &nbsp;including any required deposit. If the Bank initiates or elects arbitration, the Bank will pay &nbsp;the entire amount of the arbitration fees, including any required deposit. The Bank will also &nbsp;be responsible for payment and/or reimbursement of any arbitration fees to the extent that &nbsp;such fees exceed the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if your Claim had &nbsp;been brought in the state or federal court nearest your residence with jurisdiction over the &nbsp;Claims. </span></p><p class="c256"><span class="c4">g. </span><span class="c8">Procedure. </span><span class="c4">A single arbitrator will resolve the Claims. The arbitrator will be a lawyer with &nbsp;at least ten years&rsquo; experience or who is a former or retired judge. The arbitration will follow &nbsp;the AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures in effect on the date the arbitration is filed, except when &nbsp;there is a conflict or inconsistency between the AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures and this &nbsp;arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will govern. Any in-person arbitration hearing for a Claim will take place within the federal judicial district in which &nbsp;you live or at such other reasonably convenient location as agreed by the parties. The &nbsp;arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, &nbsp;9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1 et seq. (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">FAA</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;), and will honor all claims of privilege and confidentiality &nbsp;recognized at law. All statutes of limitations that would otherwise be applicable will apply &nbsp;to any arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief &nbsp;would be available in court under law or in equity. Any appropriate court may enter &nbsp;judgment upon the arbitrator&rsquo;s aware. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a &nbsp;transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by the FAA.</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c16">39 </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c10">Appendix A </span></p><p class="c96"><span class="c10">Online and Mobile Banking Agreement </span></p><p class="c283"><span class="c4">1. </span></p><p class="c133"><span class="c60 c45">Introduction</span><span class="c4">.
